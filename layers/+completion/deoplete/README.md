## Description

This layer adds support for auto-completion.

Shougo/denite.nvim and Shougo/deoplete.nvim are no longer developed by the author. Migration to the Shougo/ddu.vim and Shougo/ddc.vim respective replacements is suggested.

From deoplete-faq:
> * If you use denite.nvim, deoplete will be better than other plugins. Python based.
> * completion-nvim is Lua based plugin for neovim. You cannot use it in Vim8. If you like Lua, you don't use Vim8, and you don't like external dependency, it is a better choice.
> * If you use vim-lsp plugin, you should use asyncomplete.vim instead. Because asyncomplete is created for vim-lsp and it maintained as well.
> * coc.nvim is Node.js based huge plugin. It is not just completion plugin, it is all in one IDE system. It is similar with YouCompleteMe. If you don't like Node.js based plugin or huge plugin base system, you should not choose coc.nvim.
